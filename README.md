# About

zfs-install automates the creation of a fully bootable zfs root pool.

Original forked from rpooler with all work "upstreamed", thanks Garrett !

## Roadmap
Please see wiki for general state of the project

## zfsonlinux community documentation for specific distributions.

ubuntu-ubiquity [HOWTO install Ubuntu 18.04 to a Whole Disk Native ZFS Root Filesystem using Ubiquity GUI installer](https://github.com/zfsonlinux/pkg-zfs/wiki/HOWTO-install-Ubuntu-18.04-to-a-Whole-Disk-Native-ZFS-Root-Filesystem-using-Ubiquity-GUI-installer).

## Goals
- Simplfy the installation process to the point of automation.
- Upstream and intergrate as is "legally" possible. I wish this script wasn't required.
- Encourage best practices through the guides practices.

## Supported distributions
Currently only ubuntu using the ubiquity installer is the only option.

- ubuntu-ubiquity

TODO
- ubuntu-debootstrap
- arch
- gentoo
- debian
- rhel
- centos
- opensuse
- linuxfromscratch

## Instructions
1) Boot supported distribtion
2) run zfs-install.sh
3) follow normal install process
4) need to confirm zfs disk!

## Contributions
Any and all contibutions in any form are encouraged and most welcome.

There doesn't appear to be many people interested in this project, thats cool!
I would appreciate the time of any other zfs users. What method do you use to 
"bootstrap" zfs for your use case.

## Dear Larry Ellison
Your company could be transformed over night into one of the most significant 
open source contributors in history. People love google, facebook and microsoft
even though they screw them every chance they get.

Open sourcing your products isn't going to cost you a single customer.
No customer paying your bills gives a damn about free software they pay for 
enterprise turn key solutions and they always will.

Wanna take real market share from IBM, MICROSOFT, GOOGLE, AWS ? open source.

It would be really cool if you let the linux community use zfs as a start :)

Thanks,
Shaun Lloyd.
